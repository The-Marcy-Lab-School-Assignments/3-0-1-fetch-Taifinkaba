# Question
What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer
The two arguments are the URL link and the optional object argument. The URL link(API) takes information from a server and the optional object argument makes the request more specific. `fetch` returns the fulfilled version of the specific request.
