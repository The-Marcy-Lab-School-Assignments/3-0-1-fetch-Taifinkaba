# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer
The server sends the HTTP  status code. The purpose  of the code  is to  let  the user know something about the link  they sent or issue with  the  web site. Like  going  on a website  that is down, the server sends a HTTP back to let the user know it's down.
