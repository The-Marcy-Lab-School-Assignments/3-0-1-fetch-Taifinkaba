# Question
Please define what each HTTP verb does. Then, provide an example of when you would use it.

- GET
- POST
- PUT/PATCH
- DELETE

# Answer
1. GET - is used to "get" server data without changing the server.

EX: It's like asking a worker to see a pizza menu.

2. POST - is used to update server data with the data you give.

EX: It's like updating your menu so the order reflects what you want on the pizza or type of pizza.

3. PUT/PATCH - Both update the server. PUT updates everything. PATCH updates part of the server.

EX: Adding extra toppings to the pizza.

4. DELETE - is to remove data from the server.

EX: Canceling the order or removing things on/in the pizza.
